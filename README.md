# Ayushman Bisht


Hello, I am Ayushman Bisht, a rising 10th grader at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, California, USA. I do research at Algoverse AI Research, where I work on a project about the effects of cognitive and implicit biases on LLMs. I started doing research this year, and I am very excited to continue. Some of my other interests include speech and debate, and basketball.
